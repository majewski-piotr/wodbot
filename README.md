## About
This is simple discord bot for rolling dices on discord chanels for World of Darkness games. Currently it supports three types of common rolls: plain, with set difficulty and with specialization.
I plan to add support for registering accounts, creating and storing character sheets as well as using saved character's statisctics in rolls.
